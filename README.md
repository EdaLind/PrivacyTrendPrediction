## üéØ Core Concept

### FHE Contract Privacy Trend Prediction - Confidential Prediction Analysis

The platform revolutionizes traditional prediction markets by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** at the smart contract level. This breakthrough technology enables:

- **Encrypted Data Processing**: Predictions remain encrypted throughout the entire analysis process
- **Zero-Knowledge Aggregation**: Multiple predictions are combined without exposing individual values
- **Confidential Computation**: Statistical analysis performed directly on encrypted data
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: No sensitive prediction data is ever revealed on-chain

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Analyst Verification System
- Only verified analysts can participate in prediction cycles
- Reputation scoring based on historical accuracy
- Decentralized verification process managed by contract owner

### 2. Prediction Cycle Management
- **24-hour prediction cycles** with structured time windows
- **6-hour submission window** for encrypted prediction input
- **18-hour analysis window** for confidential data processing
- Automated cycle progression with transparent timing

### 3. Confidential Prediction Submission
- Analysts submit trend values (0 to 4,294,967,295 range)
- Confidence levels (0-100%) attached to each prediction
- Unique data hash prevents duplicate or manipulated submissions
- All data encrypted using FHE before blockchain storage

### 4. Privacy-Preserving Analysis
- Encrypted predictions aggregated using homomorphic operations
- Statistical computations performed without decryption
- Results remain confidential until explicitly requested
- Async decryption only for authorized result access
